How to create a docker image.

1) Install the app from scratch(on a new host) including all the dependencies and make sure its working fine.

2) Using the 'History' command, write down all the commands you had to run to intall the dependencies. Say,
	app-get update
	app-get install -y python
	app-get install python-pip
	pip install flask
	Create/Copy application code to /opt/app.py
	
	FLASK_APP=/opt/app.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0
	
3) Create a DockerFile in a directory
	cat > DockerFile

4) Contents:

// first statement of a dockerfile must always start from the 'FROM' command. You can give an OS or an existing valid docker image after the 'FROM' keyword.
FROM ubuntu

// use 'RUN' to run all the commands that you discovered are dependencies of the app.
RUN app-get update
RUN app-get install -y python
RUN app-get install python-pip
RUN pip install flask

// Now copy the required sourcecode into the appropriate file inside docker container.
// Here we are copying the app.py to the '/opt/app.py' location.
COPY app.py /opt/app.py

// Use ENTRYPOINT to provide command to initially run your application.
ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/app.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0

5) Use 'docker build .' command to build the docker image.

Note: you can also give a tag to the image while building it. For example:
docker build . -t my-simple-web-app
